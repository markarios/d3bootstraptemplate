 | compositeChart

 If the *** chart is a sub-chart in a [Composite Chart](#composite-chart) then pass in the parent composite
 chart instance.

* parent : string | node | selection - any valid
 [d3 single selector](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Selections#selecting-elements) specifying
 a dom block element such as a div; or a dom element or d3 selection.

* chartGroup : string (optional) - name of the chart group this chart instance should be placed in.
 Interaction with a chart will only trigger events and redraws within the chart's group.
